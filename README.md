# DiseaseSimulation
Simple program to prepare a disease simulation, where setting number of population, their conditions and after complete simulation save data from this which use for example to create graph

Each person has a health level that changes during each turn, a high enough health level allows you to survive the disease, too low results in the death of the person

## Sample illustration and graph
Program during simulation create
